Tools provided by Matt Holmberg along with the source code.

Most (all?) of the .exes won't work, but the tools can still be used by installing VB6 and opening the project files.
The most useful is probably MrYuk, which enables viewing and editing the maps.

VB6 can be downloaded here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/Download/confirmation.aspx?id=10019

This link provides steps for installing and running it on Windows 10: https://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/installing_vb6_on_win10.htm
Note that it uses a no-longer-available download for the files. Also, the steps about setting compatibility mode don't seem to be necessary.
(If anyone has more complete and up-to-date instructions for installing VB6, please share them--I don't remember everything I did to get it working.)
